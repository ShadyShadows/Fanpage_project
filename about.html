      <h1>What is Bloons Tower Defense 6?</h1>
      <p>Bloons Tower Defense 6, usually abbreviated to btd6, is a tower defense game where you place monkeys to stop bloons from invading your village. You can place stronger monkeys or upgrade your existing ones with cash that is earned by popping bloons. There are many diffrent types of bloons you should look out for, like camo bloons that only certain monkeys can spot, or lead bloons that normal darts can't pierce. In a normal game you will have to go through multiple rounds of bloons, and after every round the difficulty increases.</p>
      <p>You also have heros in this game that you can place out. They do very unique things such as make money, grant certain buffs for your towers, or simply do damage. I recommend you try out the newest hero Geraldo.</p>
<p>This hero is unique in the fact that he has a shop where you can spend your cash to use his powerful items. He has a item for every situation, and I think that he is by far the best hero, he just costs cash to use his items.</p>
